# React-Movie-Search-App

https://ksmith8888.github.io/React-Movie-Search-App/

An app to fetch movie data from an API, through a proxy server. Users are able to search for movies by title, which fetches relevant results from the Open Movie Database. Requests are first sent though a proxy server (Proxy Server Project) to ensure that the API key is not sent to the client and that usage is limited. Built with the Parcel bundler.

Made with React, HTML and CSS. 

Movie data courtesy of the Open Movie Database: https://www.omdbapi.com/
